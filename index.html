        		<h1>Hi there, I'm Adila Krisnadhi!</h1>
				<p>I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Wright State University (WSU). I am also affiliated with the Knoesis Center. I work under supervision of Prof. Pascal Hitzler in the Data Semantics Lab. My study is supported by Fulbright Foreign Student Grant - Indonesia Presidential Scholarship 2010 as well as the TROn project. My main research interest lies in the area of knowledge representation and engineering for the Semantic Web. Further details about my research is available on my research page.<p>

<p>I obtained my Master of Science degree in Computational Logic from Technische Universit√§t Dresden, Germany in the year of 2007. My Master's thesis was a study of data complexity for the EL-family of description logics. This work was completed under supervision of Dr. Carsten Lutz and was done at Prof. Franz Baader's Automata Theory Group.</p>

<p>I am also both a lecturer and an alumnus of the Faculty of Computer Science, Universitas Indonesia. There, I obtained my Bachelor degree in Computer Science in 2002 and then joined as a faculty since 2003. As an undergraduate student, I worked under Prof. Benyamin Kusumoputro on face recognition systems. See my teaching page for list of courses that I taught there.</p>
